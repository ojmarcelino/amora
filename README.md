## First thoughts

WTF?! ok, amora stands for (with a small cognitve stupid humour):

- Awesome MObile Remote Access

Before the blame / mimimi / missiles / lasers / blasters / lightsabers...
Heck, I was wondering....
...why just use scrscpy to access an old android device to test /whatever,
when it's possible to use it (shell) to do a lot more useful stuff?

For instance, why not leave it always on landscape, or always with screen brightness off, or whatever other commands?
Of course, executed right before the access and
to enable or disable some favorite/needed feature, just replace one flag, or whatever, pass it through on shell...

## Contribution

Just open your mind and then open a PR with any deviant cognitive suggestions or improvements.

## Warnings

Here would be some important text on the safe use of remote applications,
some sermon on misuse or other pompous and eloquent text,
but I'm not creative right now to put it all here (maybe next time),
so use it at your discretion.

That's all, folks!
